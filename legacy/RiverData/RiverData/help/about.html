    <h3>Tips, Tricks, and FAQs</h3>
    
    <p><h3>Zooming in on the map is sometimes slow?</h3>
    Depending on your device hardware, it may take a second or two for the maps to refresh in highly concetrated areas of sites. If you see this looking at the entire US view, try switching to just a single state.
    <p>
    
    <p><h3>Offline Use?</h3>
    You can use river data for offline use for the map views. This app has all the sites built into the app for quick offline access for you to search and favorite. You must have a network connection to access any gauge data from USGS.
    <p>


    <p><h3>How do you refresh data?</h3>
    All screens that display USGS water data support pull-to-refresh. Simply swipe the screen downward and new data will be requested from USGS servers.
    <p>
    
    <p><h3>How do I favorite a site?</h3>
    There is a star in the upper right corner of a site summary. Simply tap the star and once it is illuminated yellow it will appear under the Favorites tab.
    <p>
    
    <p><h3>How can I rename a favorite site?</h3>
    Under the Favorites tab, tap the Edit button and then tap the river name display name you want to edit.
    <p>
    
    <p><h3>How can I get you to add more rivers?</h3>
    All rivers come from USGS. I have no control over the rivers listed in this app, so if you don't see the river it's becuase it is not monitored, you are looking under the wrong state, or the river may be monitored by a seperated state agency.
    <p>
    
    <p><h3>Why does't my favorite river have as many gauges as other river sites?</h3>
    Each river site has a different number of gauges. The number of gauges and what they do it dependent on funding from USGS and what they choose to monitor.
    <p>
    
    <p><h3>How do I share a river site?</h3>
    There is a share icon at the top right of the screen with the gauge chart. Simply tap the share icon and you can share a single-gauge's current data reading as well as the chart image currently displayed. Sharing supports all the common methods of sharing such as, email, text message, Facebook, Twitter and more.
    
    <p><h3>How do I zoom a chart?</h3>
   Charts for river gauges support pinch-to-zoom, double tap to zoom, or two-finger tap to zoom out.
    <p>
    
    <p><h3>Why does the gauge value have -999999?</h3>
    Some gauges may be out or no longer in service. In this case the value will typically be -99999 and in most cases there will be no chart available for that site.
